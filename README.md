🌌 42 Berlin Space Club — Vision (General, English)

Vision
The 42 Berlin Space Club is a lightweight, curiosity-driven group exploring what’s possible with modern space technology. We focus on the open and mostly free tools available through programs like Copernicus, OpenEO, Earth observation platforms, and cloud-based analysis services.
Our goal is simply to discover what exists, understand how to access it, and experiment with turning satellite data into meaningful, creative, or just fun projects.

What we do
We meet every two weeks for around 25 minutes to share short insights, show tiny demos, explore tools, or present project ideas. No pressure, no prerequisites — just a place to learn together.

Why we do it
Space technology is more accessible than ever: free datasets, open APIs, cloud processing, even ready-made notebooks. We want to help people understand where to create accounts, how to use the platforms, and how to combine them into something interesting — even if we don’t yet know what the final projects will look like. The point is to explore, experiment, and keep learning.

Our principles

Open access: We use open data, open tools, open APIs

Low barrier: No background knowledge required

Short & impactful: Quick meetings, small demos, steady progress

Exploration-first: We start broad, discover tools, then build ideas

Community-driven: Anyone can contribute, show a demo, or start a project

Long-term idea
Over time, the Space Club becomes a friendly entry point into Earth observation, satellite data, and space-tech tinkering — helping students build skills, explore opportunities, collaborate on projects, and maybe even launch research, apps, or hackathon ideas.
